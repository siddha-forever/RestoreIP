# RestoreIP

The task at hand is to take a string of digits, denoted as 's', and add dots in appropriate positions to form valid IP addresses. A valid IP address consists of four distinct integers separated by a single dot. Each integer in the IP address must be within the range of 0 to 255, inclusive. Additionally, the integers should not have leading zeros. For example, "01" or "012" are not valid as they start with a zero.

To illustrate this, let's consider some examples. The string "25525511135" can be transformed into the IP address "255.255.111.35" because each integer falls within the valid range.
